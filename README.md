Out-of-Order Execution with Runahead and AVD Prediction

This example demonstrates the high-level logic of Runahead Execution and AVD (Approximate Value Derivation) Prediction in a software context. While the code does not implement all hardware mechanisms described in the paper (e.g., checkpointing or complete processor architecture), it illustrates how AVD prediction and runahead execution can collaborate to improve memory latency.

When an AVD prediction fails, the system transitions to runahead execution, speculatively pre-executing subsequent instructions to hide memory access delays.
Key Features
Instruction Execution with Runahead and AVD Prediction

    Instruction Simulation
        The function execute_instructions_with_avd_prediction simulates how an out-of-order processor executes a list of instructions.

    Cache Lookup
        For each instruction, the system first attempts to load the value from the cache using load_from_cache(instruction).
        A cache miss is indicated by a return value of -1.

    AVD Prediction
        On a cache miss, the system uses the AVD predictor to attempt a value prediction.
        If successful, the predicted value is printed, and the processor speculatively executes dependent instructions using the predicted value.

    Memory Fetch
        Regardless of AVD prediction success, the processor simulates fetching the value from memory with load_from_memory(instruction).
        Fetched data is used to update the AVD predictor for future predictions.

    Entering Runahead Mode
        If the AVD predictor fails, the system enters Runahead Mode, speculatively executing the next instruction_window_size instructions.
        Cache misses during runahead mode are ignored, allowing parallel speculative execution to reduce memory stall time.

    Handling Cache Misses During Runahead
        In runahead mode, if a cache miss occurs for any instruction, the system simulates fetching the data from memory, reflecting the delay caused by memory latency.

    Final Memory Fetch
        After runahead execution completes, the processor resolves the initial cache miss by fetching the original instruction's data from memory.

Code Artifact Overview

    AVD Prediction: Demonstrates speculative execution by predicting cache-miss values.
    Runahead Execution: Simulates pre-execution of instructions to mitigate memory latency.

How It Works

    Detect a cache miss.
    Attempt AVD prediction:
        If successful, use the predicted value for speculative execution.
        If unsuccessful, switch to runahead mode.
    Execute subsequent instructions in runahead mode to pre-fetch dependent data.
    Resolve the initial cache miss after runahead execution.
