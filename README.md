# Out-of-Order


This example code does not directly implement the complete hardware mechanisms described in the paper (such as
checkpointing and the full processor architecture), but it demonstrates the high-level logic of how runahead execution and
AVD prediction could work in a software context, when the AVD fails it moves to the runahead execution.
In the code artifact section below, when a cache miss occurs, the AVD predictor attempts to predict the data value; if
unavailable, the system enters runahead mode, speculatively pre-executing subsequent instructions to hide memory latency.


Instruction Execution with Runahead and AVD Prediction
Instruction Simulation: The function execute_instructions_with_avd_prediction processes a list of instruc-
tions, simulating how an out-of-order processor might execute them.
Cache Lookup: For each instruction, the system first tries to load the value from the cache by calling
load_from_cache(instruction). If there is a cache miss (indicated by a return value of -1), the system tries to
predict the value of the instruction using the AVD Predictor.
AVD Prediction: If the AVD predictor is available and can make a prediction, it predicts the value of the instruction that
caused the cache miss. The predicted value is printed, and the processor speculatively executes any dependent instructions
using the predicted value.
Memory Fetch: Whether the prediction is made or not, the processor simulates fetching the value from memory after the
cache miss by calling load_from_memory(instruction) and updates the AVD predictor with the fetched data.
Entering Runahead Mode: If the AVD prediction fails (i.e., no prediction is available), the system enters runahead mode.
In this mode, the processor speculatively executes the next instruction_window_size instructions, ignoring any cache
misses that may occur during this speculative execution. These instructions are executed in parallel without waiting for the
resolution of the current cache miss.
Handling Cache Misses During Runahead: While executing in runahead mode, if a cache miss occurs for any instruction,
the system fetches data from memory for that instruction, simulating the delay caused by memory latency.
Final Memory Fetch: After completing runahead execution, the processor fetches the original instructionâ€™s data from
memory to resolve the cache miss.
